The project provides an opportunity to get acquainted with the possibility of a model for predicting car price categories.

the model is trained on data that contains attributes such as: 'id', 'url', 'region', 'region_url', 'price', 'year of manufacture', 'manufacturer',
'model', 'fuel', 'odometer', 'title status', 'transmission',
'image_url', 'description', 'state', 'lat', 'long', 'posting_date',
'price_category'

For convenience, the process of data processing and model training was implemented using a pipeline.

to test the model, you need to run a local server through git and connect using postman
